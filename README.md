# LibraryApp
The Windows Application was developed and designed from 0 to 100 by me. I used several C# frameworks including, ADO.NET ,.NET Framework in order to complete the project.
It is developed for library management and it has data about customers. books, and about workers that was stored on the database also users have roles including,
managers and workers,they can alter/change data related to customers using the application.
Additionally, managers are allowed to alter information about workers and suspend workers' account anytime.
